## STUFF USED
* Node.js
* Mysql
* Express.js
* Semantic UI
* Ajax
* Ejs
* Jquery

## Front-end:

* Semantic UI: Semantic UI is a front-end framework used for designing user interfaces, including the layout and appearance of web pages. It focuses on creating a consistent and visually appealing user experience. Front-end developers primarily work with Semantic UI to build the user interface of a web application.

* Ajax: AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used in web development for making asynchronous requests to a server from the client-side (web browser) without requiring a full page refresh. It is typically used by front-end developers to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

* Ejs: EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating engine that is primarily used on the server-side for rendering dynamic content in web applications. While Ejs is a server-side technology, front-end developers might work with it indirectly to integrate dynamic data into web pages generated by the server.

* jQuery: jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies client-side scripting and is primarily used on the front-end. Front-end developers use jQuery for tasks like DOM manipulation, event handling, and creating interactive web pages.

## Back-end:

* Node.js: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It is primarily used for building the back-end of web applications, handling server-side logic, routing, and interacting with databases.

* MySQL: MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) used on the server-side to store, manage, and retrieve data. Back-end developers work with MySQL to create and manage the database schema, perform data operations, and interact with the database from the server.

* Express.js: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, primarily used on the server-side. It simplifies the process of building web applications, handling routes, and middleware for request processing. Back-end developers use Express.js to create the server logic of web applications.

## Features
* Complaint Submission
* Squad Management
* Complaint Logging and management

## How to run this project?

* To run the Anti Ragging Cell project built with Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and other technologies, follow these steps:

* Step 1: Set Up the Environment
* Install Node.js:
* Download and install Node.js from the official website.
* Verify the installation by running node -v in your command line or terminal to check the Node.js version.
* Install MySQL using Xampp recommended
* Download and install MySQL from the official website.

* Step 2: Project Setup
* Clone the Project:
* Clone or download the project from its repository to your local machine.
* Install Dependencies:
* Open a terminal or command prompt inside the project directory.
* Run npm install to install all the required dependencies listed in the package.json file.

* Step 3: Database connection Setup
* After connect to Apache and MySQL server in Xampp, Create a MySQL database for the project in xampp(http://localhost/phpmyadmin/).
* create a database named cecantiraggingcell and import the cecantiraggingcell.sql database file

* Step 4: Run the Project
* Start the Server:
* In the terminal or command prompt, run npm start or node app.js (or server.js depending on the project structure) to start the Node.js server.
* Access the Application:
* Once the server is running without any errors, open a web browser.
* Enter http://localhost:3000 in the address bar
